{"task_id": "AIME_2024/3", "problem": "Alice and Bob play a game on a $10 \\times 10$ grid. Alice places a token at the bottom-left corner. On each turn, Bob moves the token one square up or one square right (but not diagonally). Alice wins if the token reaches the top-right corner. Bob wins if he can force the token to a square where it cannot move further. How many different paths can Alice take to guarantee a win?", "answer": "000", "type": "math"}
