0.65 → 0.75 → 0.82
Total improvement: +26.2%
```

```

**Status**: ✅ **6/6 TESTS PASSED**

---

## 🎯 Key Features Verified

### 1. Deep Coupling ✅
```
Combined Score = (1 - w) * UCB + w * Q_value
                = (1 - 0.5) * 0.68 + 0.5 * 0.72
                = 0.70
✓ RL policy directly participates in MCTS selection
```

### 2. Bidirectional Learning ✅
```
AFlow → RL: 3 experiences → training data
RL → AFlow: Q-values → node selection guidance
✓ Both directions working correctly
```

### 3. Workflow-Specific GiGPO ✅
```
Episode groups: By MCTS nodes (3 different nodes)
Step groups: By workflow similarity (3 different anchors)
✓ Hierarchical grouping working
```

### 4. State Management ✅
```
States tracked: 3
Best state score: 0.82
Improvement tracking: 0.65 → 0.75 → 0.82
✓ Complete state lifecycle working
```

### 5. Experience Pool ✅
```
Experiences stored: 3
Average score: 0.740
