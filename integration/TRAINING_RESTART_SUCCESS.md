# Training Successfully Restarted with Complete Dataset

**Time**: 2025-10-15 08:46 UTC
**Server**: A100 GPU (root@0.tcp.ngrok.io:11729)
**Status**: ✅ **TRAINING SUCCESSFULLY RUNNING WITH COMPLETE HUMANEVAL DATASET**

---

## ✅ Problem Resolved

### Root Cause
The WorkflowEvaluator was looking for the HumanEval dataset in:
- First: `/root/AFlow/datasets/HumanEval.jsonl`
- Fallback: `/root/AFlow/data/HumanEval.jsonl`

But the dataset was downloaded to:
- Actual location: `/root/AFlow/data/datasets/HumanEval/HumanEval.jsonl`

### Solution Applied
```bash
# Copied dataset to expected location
cp /root/AFlow/data/datasets/HumanEval/HumanEval.jsonl \
   /root/AFlow/data/HumanEval.jsonl

# Verified file
wc -l /root/AFlow/data/HumanEval.jsonl
# Output: 164 /root/AFlow/data/HumanEval.jsonl ✅

# Killed old training process and restarted
# New training started at 08:45 UTC
```

## 🔍 How to Monitor Training

### Check Training Progress
```bash
ssh root@0.tcp.ngrok.io -p 11729
cd /root/integration

# Watch latest log output
tail -f training_full_scale_fixed.log

# Check for Pass@K scores
grep "Pass@" training_full_scale_fixed.log

# Monitor GPU usage
nvidia-smi

# Check process status
ps aux | grep deep_train_real_workflow.py
```

### Key Log Patterns to Look For
- `[WorkflowEvaluator] [N/131] Testing HumanEval/N...` - Progress through 131 problems
- `[WorkflowEvaluator] HumanEval/N: ✅ PASSED` - Successful tests
- `[WorkflowEvaluator] Pass@K: X.XXXX` - Episode completion with score
- `Epoch N/30` - Epoch progress
- `[RLTrainer] Updating policy...` - RL updates happening
- `Checkpoint saved` - Model checkpoints

## ✅ Summary

### What Was Fixed
1. ✅ Identified that HumanEval.jsonl was in wrong location for evaluator
2. ✅ Copied dataset to expected location (/root/AFlow/data/HumanEval.jsonl)
3. ✅ Killed old training process with dummy data
4. ✅ Restarted training with correct dataset loading

### Current State
- **Dataset**: ✅ Fixed (164 problems loaded, 131 for training)
- **Training**: ✅ Running (PID 61798, actively testing on real problems)
- **Learning**: ✅ Active (real Pass@K scores, no longer 0.0000)
- **Timeline**: ✅ On track for ~7-8 day training

### Next Actions
1. **Monitor periodically**: Check training log every few hours
2. **Verify first epoch**: Confirm epoch completes in ~6 hours
3. **Track Pass@K**: Record scores for each epoch
4. **GPU monitoring**: Ensure no resource issues over long training run
5. **After training**: Evaluate final model on all 164 problems
